I've released the new version of the ClamAgent and ClamSink.
This version uses the ClamAV native Windows port instead of the ClamWin executable.
This changes two things.

First: the ClamAV dlls are included into the installation package so
the installation of the ClamWin is not required anymore.

Second: with this release I've changed the version numbering scheme. The released version is
v1.1.x.0.94.2.
First number: Major version of the ClamAgent or ClamSink
Second number: Minor version of the ClamAgent or ClamSink
Third number: Build number of the ClamAgent or ClamSink
Forth number: Major version of the ClamAV
Fifth number: Minor version of the ClamAV
Sixt number: Revision number of the ClamAV
