The ClamAgent can be installed on the Exchange Edge or Hub Transport role. It is recomended to use the Edge Transport for the install location.

For example:
C:\DATA\ClamAgent\log
C:\DATA\ClamAgent\debug
C:\DATA\ClamAgent\quarantine
C:\DATA\ClamAgent\temp

4. Determine the account who runs the Exchange Transport Service (by default it is the NETWORK SERVICE account)
In the Administrative Tools start the Services console and check the Log on As column of the Microsoft Exchange Transport

5. Grant full controll right to the service account determined in step 4 to the directories created in step 3.
